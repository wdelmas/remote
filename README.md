# Remote

Remote as the name entails, is a remote, but for your browser ðŸŽ‰

Nowadays, most of the content is available through the browser. 
However your browser is not always accessible straight from your TV,
 so you end up displaying your computer's screen on your TV.

Remote is the missing controller for your browser, 
 especially when you're showing video content on TV.

## Installing

### Chrome Webstore

Install it directly from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remote/hifbccioeoaheffkmedjiphppjpcbfeh)

### Build it locally

```
npm i               # Installs dependencies
typings install     # Install typings
npm run build:all   # Builds the server, the client and the extension
npm start           # Launches the server
```

Now you can add the remote to Chrome via [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

Click the Load unpacked extension button and select the folder `build/extensions`

## Using

Scan the QRCode given by the extension when you click on it

... and that's it ðŸ˜„ Happy controlling !
